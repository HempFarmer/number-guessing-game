# Number Guessing Game 🎯

A beginner-friendly C++ console game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. This project demonstrates core programming fundamentals including:

- Input/output
- Conditional logic
- Loops
- Random number generation
- Input validation

## 🛠 Features

- Random number generation between 1 and 100
- Repeats until the user guesses correctly
- Validates non-numeric and out-of-range input
- Option to play again after each round

## 🧠 What I Learned

- Writing `while` loops and `if` statements
- Handling input using `cin`
- Generating random numbers with `rand()` and `srand()`
- Organizing logic into functions for clarity

## 🚀 How to Run

Compile and run in any C++-friendly environment such as Visual Studio, Code::Blocks, or using `g++` in the terminal.
